## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3


## Setup

The raw HTML content was provided by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
Very basic CSS codes were also provided by them. It just included rudimentary
stylings such as page layout and some basic setups.

My task was to style the text using CSS.

I downloaded two different fonts from google fonts and embeded them into the 
page using `@font-face`.

All texts, links, lists, header, and sidebars were styled while keeping CSS's 
best practices in mind.

## Project Status

Project is: _no longer being worked on_. But maybe I consider to make the page
responsive in a later time.


## Room for Improvement

I think that this project can be improved by improving or adding the features
below:

- Making the page responsive
- Adding a hamburger menu
- Adding more content to the page
- The style of the page can still be improved
